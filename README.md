# SQL-Team-Assignment

The SQL assignment was the 2nd asssignment in our Bootcamp and the focus was on team building and collaborative work where we were divided into different groups and then shared our work and guided each other if we had issues. We were given a database and given a set of insructions so we have to make and run our queries as one query can be performed in different ways so it was a good idea to do it in groups. 
We also have to make 1 extra query on top of the given queries.



We also had to make an EER ( Enhanced Entity Relationship) Diagram.
